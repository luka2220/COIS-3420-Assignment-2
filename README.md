## Setup and Run
To get my project set up and run on any computer or operating system, download the source code (ecommerce-store), head into the directory, and run `npm i` to install all the packages. Next, run the command `npm run dev` to get the website running and click the link to view the web page.

## Overview
This is a simple application to allows users to create an account, login, reset passwords, update profile information, and save products. 

## Libraries and Frameworks
I used vite to create the initial project which requires node to be installed. I used vite to allow me to have JavaScript modules in my application and to install npm packages. I installed the Firebase npm package to allow me to initialize my firebase app, create new users, and update data. I preferred this over the firebase cdn which is outdated.
